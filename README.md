# kubernetes-homelab
Kubernetes lab env, created to test/bootstrap a kubernetes cluster in a homelab setting. Not the most elegant/clean ansible yaml/tf resource files but it works in my specific case :-)

https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/ helped a lot with getting the right binaries and config files ❤️
